 `movies.csv` (custom or extended movie dataset)


🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Rating-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook MovieRatingAnalysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Review or run the SQL queries inside `movieReviewAnalysis.sql` using your preferred SQL environment.

📌 Notes

- The CSV files may be large (over 25MB), so upload them using Git or Git LFS, not the GitHub web interface.
- The project is intended for data analysis practice and educational use.
